This is importing a function named `tweet` from a file
    that we unfortunately don't have access to change.

You use it like so:
>>> tweet("Hello this is my tweet")

If the function cannot connect to Twitter,
    the function will raise a `CommunicationError`
If the message is too long,
    the function will raise a `MessageTooLongError`

#Unfortunately Twitter can change the maximum amount of characters allowed at any time.


#The only thing we know is that a MessageTooLongError will be raised if that happens.


#The exception has additional messaging, so let's catch the exception and print it out:

#"Oh no! Your message was too long (...)"

#Where ... is the text from the exception.
